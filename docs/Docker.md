Running openNetVM in Docker
==

To run openNetVM NFs inside Docker containers, use the
included [Docker Script][docker]. This script does the following:

  - Creates a Docker container with a custom name
  - Maps NIC devices from the host into the container
  - Maps the shared hugepage region into the container
  - Maps the openNetVM directory into the container
  - Maps any other directories you want into the container
  - Configures the container to use all of the shared memory and data
    structures
  - Depending on the presence of a path or not, the container starts the NF
    automatically in detached mode or the terminal is connected to it to
    run the NF by hand

Usage
--

To use the script, simply run it from the command line with the
following options:

    ```
    sudo ./docker.sh -h HUGEPAGES -o ONVM -n NAME [-D DEVICES] [-d DIRECTORY] [-w WORKING DIRECTORY] [-c COMMAND]
    ```

  - `HUGEPAGES - A path to where the hugepage filesystem is on the host`
  - `ONVM - A path to the openNetVM directory on the host filesystem`
  - `NAME - A name to give the container`
  - `DEVICES - An optional comma deliniated list of NIC devices to map to the
    container`
  - `DIRECTORY - An optional additional directory to map inside the container.`
  - `WORKINGDIRECTORY - An optional directory in the container to be the working
     directory at start time. It allows a better control on the command to be run.`
  - `COMMAND - An optional command to run in the container. For example,
     the path to a go-docker script or to the executable of your NF.`

    ```
    sudo ./docker.sh -h /mnt/huge -o /root/openNetVM -n Basic_Monitor_NF
-D /dev/uio0,/dev/uio1
    ```

  - This will start a container with two NIC devices mapped in, /dev/uio0
and /dev/uio1, the hugepage directory at `/mnt/huge` mapped in, and the
openNetVM source directory at `/root/openNetVM` mapped into the
container with the name of Basic_Monitor_NF.

    ```
    sudo ./docker.sh -h /mnt/huge -o /root/openNetVM -n Simple_Forward_NF
-D /dev/uio0 -w /openNetVM/examples/simple_forward -c "./go-docker.sh 5 1 1"
    ```

  - This will start a container with one NIC device mapped in, /dev/uio0
, the hugepage directory at `/mnt/huge` mapped in, and the
openNetVM source directory at `/root/openNetVM` mapped into the
container with the name of Simple_Forward_NF. Also, the container will be
started in detached mode (no connection to it). It will have the simple_forward
subdirectory as its working directory, and it will run the go-docker script of
the simple forward NF.
Careful, the path needs to be correct inside the container (use absolute path,
 here the openNetVM directory is mapped in the /).


Running NFs Inside Containers
--

To run an NF inside of a container, use the provided script which creates a new container and presents you with its shell.  From there, if you run `ls`, you'll see that inside the root directory, there is an `openNetVM` directory.  This is the same openNetVM directory that is on your host - it is mapped from your local host into the container.  Now enter that directory and go to the example NFs or enter the other directory that you mapped into the container located in the root of the filesystem.  From there, you can run the `go.sh` script to run your NF.

Some prerequisites are:

  - Compile all applications from your local host.  The Docker container is not configured to compile NFs.
  - Make sure that the openNetVM manager is running first on your local host.

Here is an example of starting a container and then running an NF inside of it:

```
root@nimbnode /root/openNetVM # ./scripts/docker.sh

sudo ./docker.sh -h HUGEPAGES -o ONVM -n NAME [-D DEVICES] [-d DIRECTORY] [-w WORKINGDIRECTORY] [-c COMMAND]

    e.g. sudo ./docker.sh -h /hugepages -o /root/openNetVM -n Basic_Monitor_NF -D /dev/uio0,/dev/uio1
    This will create a container with two NIC devices, uio0 and uio1,
    hugepages mapped from the host's /hugepage directory and openNetVM
    mapped from /root/openNetVM and it will name it Basic_Monitor_NF

root@nimbnode /root/openNetVM # ./scripts/docker.sh -h /hugepages -o /home/neel/openNetVM -n ExampleNF -D /dev/uio0,/dev/uio1
root@2f20c33f9d69:/# ls
bin  boot  dev  etc  home  hugepages  lib  lib64  media  mnt  openNetVM  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
root@2f20c33f9d69:/# cd openNetVM/
root@2f20c33f9d69:/openNetVM# ls
CPPLINT.cfg  LICENSE  Makefile  README.md  docs  dpdk  examples  onvm  scripts  style  tags
root@2f20c33f9d69:/openNetVM# cd examples/
root@2f20c33f9d69:/openNetVM/examples# ls
Makefile  basic_monitor  bridge  flow_table  simple_forward  speed_tester  test_flow_dir
root@2f20c33f9d69:/openNetVM/examples# cd basic_monitor/
root@2f20c33f9d69:/openNetVM/examples/basic_monitor# ls
Makefile  README.md  basic_monitor  build  go.sh  monitor.c
root@2f20c33f9d69:/openNetVM/examples/basic_monitor# ./go.sh
./go.sh CPU-LIST SERVICE-ID [-p PRINT] [-n NF-ID]
./go.sh 3 0 --> core 3, Service ID 0
./go.sh 3,7,9 1 --> cores 3,7, and 9 with Service ID 1
./go.sh -p 1000 -n 6 3,7,9 1 --> cores 3,7, and 9 with Service ID 1 and Print Rate of 1000 and instance ID 6
root@2f20c33f9d69:/openNetVM/examples/basic_monitor# ./go.sh 3 1
...
```

You can also use the optional command argument to run directly the NF inside of the container (and the optional working directory argument to have more control on the command context of execution), without connecting to it. Then, to stop gracefully the NF (so it has time to notify onvm manager), use the docker stop command before docker rm the container.
The prerequisites are the same as in the case where you connect to the container.

```
root@nimbnode /root/openNetVM # ./scripts/docker.sh -h /hugepages -o /home/adam/openNetVM -n ExampleNF -D /dev/uio0,/dev/uio1 -w /openNetVM/examples/simple_forward/ -c "./go-docker.sh 5 1 1"

root@nimbnode /root/openNetVM # sudo docker stop ExampleNF
ExampleNF
root@nimbnode /root/openNetVM # sudo docker rm ExampleNF
ExampleNF
...
```
